# Manager Readme

Hi, I'm James. This document is my intention to get off on the right foot with our relationship with me as your manager. You will hopefully get an idea of how I think and how I work.

## About me

I live in Quincy MA with my wife Sara. We have a baby on the way in January.

I've worked at Maxwell Health for almost 5 years. When I first started my role was building out the MVP with a small team, then took on more of a lead role. I've been managing people in addition to my lead role responsibilities for the last 3 years.

My background is non traditional. I went to Emerson college to study audio engineering. Despite some front end exprience, the majority of my software engineering experience happened after college.

Outside of work, I have a number of hobbies. I enjoy programming and maintain a number of projects. Most notably, [React-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) a popular open source project. I played in a band in high school and college, so I enjoy making music and seeing it live. I run pretty regularly and have run several half marathons.

## My role

I'm an Engineering Manager here at Maxwell Health. I also lead teams here as well. What does that mean:

* I'm a people manager
  * I retain world class talent (That's you!)
    * I'm here to make you feel successful and happy in your role
    * I want to improve your technical skills. But also your ability to be autonomous, have influence, your knowledge of the business, and your ability to execute.
    * Ultimately, I want to grow your career.
    * Processes that I help define and implement are meant to scale the organization. This means that the team needs to be prepared through learning and experience to participate in those processes.
  * I attract new talent
    * When we are ready to expand our team, my role involves finding, screening, interviewing, and hiring individuals.
    * A large part of attracting talent is making sure we have the right team, projects, and processes in place for them to be successful. I help shape those things.
    * It also means building out our engineering brand. Writing, speaking, and presenting outside of Maxwell to make sure people understand what we're about.
* I lead teams
  * I set technical strategy
    * I drive technical and architectural strategy within teams but also faciliate conversations between teams.
    * I identify and manage technical debt.
    * I help to facilitate decision making.
  * I plan and own the execution
    * Accountable for the full lifecycle and excellence of software engineering: the analysis, estimation, implementation, quality, infrastrucutre and operations.
    * Work with product management to establish a planning horizon of 3 quarters
    * Improve and vet our estimation.
    * I try to eliminate risk. However, I play a large role in crisis management when things do go sideways.
    * Enable the team to produce their best work.
    * Drive cross-functional and cross-cutting initiatives.


## Interactions

* I will try to be as transparent as possible with you. However, there will be some things I can't discuss as part of my role (How much do other people make?).
* I'll have opinions about the work you are doing. They aren't always right. Feel free to work with me on finding good solutions and also feel empowered to challenge me on my opinions.
* Come to me when things feel off or you feel "Hey this is something I could use James' help on." Do not wait for a 1-1 to address issues. There are very few things on my calendar that I can't reschedule (usually interviews). If you feel like you need to take that time feel free message me on Slack or come up to me in person and we can hop in a room/on a call.
* I value continuous learning. I expect folks to develop plans with me to how they can grow. We can discuss these in our One on ones...

## 1-1s
* We will have 1-1s weekly to the best of my ability.
* This is a safe space for us to discuss things that are not appropriate in a group setting.
* Please come to these meetings with an agenda. I will have agenda items as well but this meeting should largely be driven by things _you_ want to discuss.
* I am not _usually_ looking for work status updates in these meetings, however that may come up.
* I will give you feedback on how you're doing in our one-on-ones. This will include feedback I receive from others.
* I encourage you to write down agenda items throughout the week. Rather than, only bringing up things in the moment. Agendas sent ahead of time are encouraged.

### 1-1 potential topics:
  * How can we make you succesful in your role? Are there impediments that are making that difficult?
  * How can we get you the skills you need to grow into your next role?
  * Opportunities to get to know you and you to know me as humans
  * Who do you work with who is doing an awesome job?
  * What is an opportunity we're missing out on?
  * People problems!
  * Software problems!
  * What are some things you are learning about?
  * What are some things I can do better?
  * What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

## FAQ

* What's with the mug "Mr. James Hardass"? - Early on at Maxwell we had a significant quality issue in our organization. I was asked to lead a small team of people to oversee the quality of the Customer success team's implementations of their portals. Cory Noonan decided that it would be a good way to describe the situation. I don't consider myself a hardass.
